## üìö Prerequisites

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

## üë®‚Äçüè´ Instructions

To get started follow the steps below:

1. Open a terminal and run this commands to clone this repo and install dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/luloxi/PunkSociety.git
cd PunkSociety
yarn install
```

2. After everything is installed, run this command to start a local blockchain network:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Foundry. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development.

3. Duplicate and rename `packages/foundry/.env.example` to `packages/foundry/.env` (you don't need to fill it out until deploying to a live network)

4. Open a second terminal, navigate to `PunkSociety` and run this command to deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/foundry/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/foundry/script/Deploy.s.sol` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

5. Go to `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts` and comment out `targetNetworks: [chains.arbitrum]` and uncomment `targetNetworks: [chains.foundry]`

6. Open a third terminal, navigate to `PunkSociety` and run this command to start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page.
