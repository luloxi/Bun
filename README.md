DARTE is a Web3-based marketplace that empowers artists to mint and monetize their work as NFTs while providing collectors with unique investment opportunities.

Its goal is to break down the barriers for artists and collectors by providing an easy-to-use platform that fosters creativity, collaboration, and sustainable income through digital art. The platform solves the problems of high minting costs for artists, lack of continuous royalties, and limited cross-chain interoperability, allowing for a more inclusive and connected NFT ecosystem.

# About

‚öôÔ∏è Built using Foundry, NextJS, RainbowKit, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript,

üîó To be deployed on EVM compatible chains

## Roles within the platform

- Artists: Mint, remix, and earn royalties from NFTs.
- NFT Collectors: Buy, sell, auction, and collect NFTs while benefiting from features like batch buying and cross-chain transfers.
- Marketplace Owner: Collect fees from paid user operations.
- Free Users: Explore, watch, and listen to content

# Quickstart

## Prerequisites

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

## Quickstart

To get started follow the steps below:

1. Open a terminal and run this commands to clone this repo and install dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/luloxi/DARTE.git
cd DARTE
yarn install
```

2. After everything is installed, run this command to start a local blockchain network:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Foundry. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development.

3. Duplicate and rename `packages/foundry/.env.example` to `packages/foundry/.env` (you don't need to fill it out until deploying to a live network)

4. Open a second terminal, navigate to `DARTE` and run this command to deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/foundry/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/foundry/script/Deploy.s.sol` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

5. Open a third terminal, navigate to `DARTE` and run this command to start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page.

## Phase 1 ‚úÖ

- **Integrate GraphQL to index NFTs** and save RPC calls (Reference: [Bootstrap a Full Stack Modern dapp using the Scaffold-ETH CLI and Subgraph Extension](https://siddhantk08.hashnode.dev/bootstrap-a-full-stack-modern-dapp-using-the-scaffold-eth-cli-and-subgraph-extension))

### NFT Creation

- ‚úÖ **Add music to NFTs metadata** and **integrate with frontend** (Reference: [OpenSea metadata-standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards))
- ‚úÖ **Create NFT factory and NFT contract**
- ‚úÖ **Page for minting** that takes inputs for the metadata of the NFT (Reference: [scaffold-class](https://github.com/luloxi/scaffold-class))
- ‚úÖ **Display NFT being built as a preview** before minting (display the NFT and the metadata)
- ‚úÖ **Add an option to start a collection paying gas** on the Create page, with a toggle to switch between gasless and paying gas
- ‚úÖ **Allow setting max tokenId and price**

### Marketplace

- ‚úÖ **Page for interacting with the marketplace** buy and sell functions (Reference: [Simple Marketplace w/ Royalties)](https://app.buidlguidl.com/build/UxFNxy5XIMzz9mHKUxy5))
- ‚úÖ Payment in native gas token **and USDC token**
- ‚úÖ **Display created NFTs in the marketplace**
- **Display auction info and interactions**

### Social

- ‚úÖ **Add a profile for the collector** with their NFTs and info about them
- ‚úÖ **Add a way for users to register their info**
- **Add individual NFT pages** with more info about the NFT, if it's on sale, and the artist and bigger images
- **Allow seeing other collectors profiles** and their NFTs

## Phase 2

### NFT Creation

- **Gasless minting function** for artists to upload their metadata to IPFS and sign a EIP 712 message, and then wait for an investor (first minter) to pay for the contract creation transaction.
- **Implement a database to store the signatures** that allows first minters to start a collection (Reference: [grants.buidlguidl.com](https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/grants.buidlguidl.com))
- **Determine which Royalty standard to implement**, and start implementing it (References: [ERC-2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) | [ERC-4910](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4910) | [ERC-721C compared to ERC-2981 and ERC-4910](https://blog.xp.network/the-battle-for-nft-royalties-meet-the-erc-2981-erc-4920-and-erc-721c-b71d6ba28acf)
- **First minter gets a share of the royalties** of all the NFTs minted in that collection
- **"Inspired by" feature for NFTs**, meaning that a new NFT can use other NFTs validated to be used as an inspiration for their creation (text, video, image, audio) and all featured NFTs show the pieces that were created in their page, and their artists earn a percentag of the royalties.

### Marketplace

- **Add NFTs available for first minting** reading from the database with signatures collected through the gasless mint process

### Social

- **Add a way for users to register their info with a signature**
- Introduce **social features** like creating profiles, following artists, liking NFTs, and commenting on NFTs

## Phase 3

### Social

- **System to validate artists and collectors (and maybe enable them to gasless mint and be able to disable them to prevent spam)**
- **Artist NFT (limited edition)**: Holders of artists NFTs get access to backstage, events, a free drink on live events, etc
- **Token gated content**: Holders of an artist's NFTs get access to special content for holders
- **Feature for creating collections** of NFTs and displaying them in a gallery

### Music player

- **Music player as a PWA** that allows controlling the music from the notifications center on mobile devices (Reference: [React Player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player))
- **Upload the NFT Metadata to Filecoin** instead of IPFS (Reference: [Filecoin NFT Storage](https://docs.filecoin.io/))

## Phase 4

- Add support for other languages (Spanish, etc)

### Marketplace

- **Batch buying NFTs**, to reduce gas fees and the amount of transactions a user needs to make
- **Mixed pay** that allows paying in USDC or native gas token for the same amount of USD, and/or maybe crosschain payments with USDC CCTP or Chainlink CCIP (integrate Chainlink Price Feeds with AggregatorV3Interface) (Reference: [Easy2Pay](https://github.com/luloxi/Easy2Pay))
- Consider transitioning ownership of the marketplace to a DAO
- **Functionality to move NFTs between blockchains** with Chainlink CCIP token transfer (Reference: [Chainlink CCIP Cross-chain Tokens](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/tutorials/cross-chain-tokens))
- **Support for ERC1155** in the marketplace, gasless mint (rethink) and music player
- Go through [Artion Contracts](https://github.com/Fantom-foundation/Artion-Contracts) and see what **improvements can be made to the marketplace**

### Social

- Make Profile read all the NFTs owned by the user, and **not just the ones minted through the website**
- Option to customize profile appearance (colors, shape of profile picture, etc)
- **Profile creation with web2.5 login** (Twitter, Instagram, Google, etc). Linked wallet could be with account abstraction or creating a wallet from scratch, TBD
- **Notification system** for increasing engagement (customizable and ideally with email or mobile notifications)
- **Direct Messaging system** for artists and collectors
- Ability to **make your own group/community**
- **Educational Content**: Make an interactive way to step-by-step user onboarding flow, and/or video material explaining the use of the platform, especially for artists or collectors who may be unfamiliar with Web3 concepts, NFT minting, and/or royalties to improve user adoption.
