- To see current development tasks and other info about the project, [see here](https://lulox.notion.site/TECHNAI-3458ad216e8c40a9b4489fe026146552?pvs=74)

## Prerequisites

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

## Quickstart

To get started follow the steps below:

1. Open a terminal and run this commands to clone this repo and install dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/luloxi/Technai-foundry.git
cd Technai-foundry
yarn install
```

2. After everything is installed, run this command to start a local blockchain network:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Foundry. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development.

3. Duplicate and rename `packages/foundry/.env.example` to `packages/foundry/.env` (you don't need to fill it out until deploying to a live network)

4. Open a second terminal, navigate to `Technai-foundry` and run this command to deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/foundry/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/foundry/script/Deploy.s.sol` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

5. Open a third terminal, navigate to `Technai-foundry` and run this command to start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page.

## Phase 3

### Simple Mint

- ‚úÖ **Simple minting function** for artists to upload their metadata to IPFS and sign a EIP 712 message, and then wait for an investor (first minter) to pay for the contract creation transaction.
- **Implement a database to store the signatures** that allows first minters to start a collection (Reference: [grants.buidlguidl.com](https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/grants.buidlguidl.com))
- **Determine which Royalty standard to implement**, and start implementing it (References: [ERC-2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) | [ERC-4910](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4910) | [ERC-721C compared to ERC-2981 and ERC-4910](https://blog.xp.network/the-battle-for-nft-royalties-meet-the-erc-2981-erc-4920-and-erc-721c-b71d6ba28acf)

## Phase 4

### Social

- Make Profile read all the NFTs owned by the user, and **not just the ones minted through the website**
- **System to validate artists and collectors (and maybe enable them to Simple Mint and be able to disable them to prevent spam)**
- **Artist NFT (limited edition)**: Holders of artists NFTs get access to backstage, events, a free drink on live events, etc
- **Token gated content**: Holders of song NFTs get access to special content for holders
- **Feature for creating collections** of NFTs and displaying them in a gallery

### Music player

- **Music player as a PWA** that allows controlling the music from the notifications center on mobile devices (Reference: [React Player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player))
- **Upload the NFT Metadata to Filecoin** instead of IPFS (Reference: [Filecoin NFT Storage](https://docs.filecoin.io/))

## Phase 5

### Marketplace

- **Batch buying NFTs**, to reduce gas fees and the amount of transactions a user needs to make
- **Mixed pay** that allows paying in USDC or native gas token for the same amount of USD, and/or maybe crosschain payments with USDC CCTP or Chainlink CCIP (integrate Chainlink Price Feeds with AggregatorV3Interface) (Reference: [Easy2Pay](https://github.com/luloxi/Easy2Pay))
- **Periodically airdrop dividends** in USDC for creators (and first minters if appliable) (may not even be necessary if royalties pay redirect funds to the creators directly)
- Consider transitioning ownership of the marketplace to a DAO
- **Functionality to move NFTs between blockchains** with Chainlink CCIP token transfer (Reference: [Chainlink CCIP Cross-chain Tokens](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/tutorials/cross-chain-tokens))
- **Support for ERC1155** in the marketplace, Simple Mint (rethink) and music player
- Go through [Artion Contracts](https://github.com/Fantom-foundation/Artion-Contracts) and see what **improvements can be made to the marketplace**

- **Notification system** for increasing engagement (customizable and ideally with email or mobile notifications)
- **Direct Messaging system** for artists and collectors
- Ability to **make your own group/community**
- **Educational Content**: Make an interactive way to step-by-step user onboarding flow, and/or video material explaining the use of the platform, especially for artists or collectors who may be unfamiliar with Web3 concepts, NFT minting, and/or royalties to improve user adoption.

### Music player

- **Tip for artists**: Enable or require tipping with tokens, and if you don‚Äôt have $ to pay, you can watch an ad as payment (i.e: for every 6 songs, 1 ad that gets distributed among the 6 artists reproduced for free).

</div>

Technai is a Web3-based marketplace that empowers artists to mint and monetize their work as NFTs while providing collectors with unique investment opportunities.

Our mission is to break down the barriers for artists and collectors by providing an easy-to-use platform that fosters creativity, collaboration, and sustainable income through digital art. The platform solves the problems of high minting costs for artists, lack of continuous royalties, and limited cross-chain interoperability, allowing for a more inclusive and connected NFT ecosystem.
